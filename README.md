# data-interaction-visualization
Project repository for Rutgers CS526 Data Interaction and Visual Analytics Spring 2018.

## Course/Project Goals  
For student to become proficient on the current major techniques and systems for algorithmic data analysis, exploration, and visual interaction. Students will complete a competitive group project that will incorporate all the facets of a software product development, namely: Conceptualization, Data Collection, Algorithm Identification, System Implementation, User Interface Design, and Software Evaluation.

## Project Description  
For this project our group chose to explore the visual analytics problem space of the classic 3D Matching problem which is NP-Hard in complexity throey. We developed a web application using Node/Express.js and MySQL for the backend, and vanilla Javascript, HTML, and Bootstrap for the front-end. The main objective of the web app is to display relationships among entities in the 3D matching problem and provide features for user interaction that allow a user to automatically generate a matching using a 2-approx. algorithm as well as manually create and/or modify a matching. This web app has the potential to serve as an academic tool for exploring the 3D Matching problem. A potential use case: investigate how adding constraints to the problem can affect the size of a maximal matching.
